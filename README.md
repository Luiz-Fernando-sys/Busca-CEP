# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### CREATING PROJECT

Project created using CRA

Command to run the project: npm start

It was necessary to install the AXIOS library to be able to work with HTTP requests. Command: npm install axios


### PROJECT STRUCTURE

Inside the package.json file we have several files necessary for the execution of the project in REACT
The 'node_modules' folder is a folder where the project's dependencies are contained and we usually never touch it.

The file 'favicon.ico' is the icon of our project that is next to the title of our page.

The following files were deleted from the 'src' folder: App.css, App.test.js, logo.svg, setupTest.js, reportWebVitals.js
And other files that got an error due to not having some more files created, so it had to be fixed.


### ARQUIVO "App.js"

Foi necessário importar uma biblioteca específica para trabalhar com ícones para usarmos o ícone dentro do botão de pesquisar na className "SearchButton"

NOTE:

It is necessary to run the command "npm install" after downloading the project to the machine and having Node JS installed for this process. After that, you can run the command "npm start"
